<h1 align="center">Hi I'm Melika!👋🏼</h1> 

I am a Backend Developer with a creative background in Computer Games Development. Let me briefly explain, I studied NC & HNC Computer Games Development at college and I completed a 16-Week Software Development Bootcamp. During the course I completed 3 projects; Python Solo Project (TravelBucketList), React Group Project (event_diary), Capstone Group Project (DRAMM_Synthesizer).

I became interested in programming when I first experienced that accomplishing feeling you feel after your code finally runs! I'm still figuring out my niche in this industry, so I'm eager to learn more and grow overall.

I enjoy team-working, socialising, and eating good food. I also love to travel and meet new people, (I blame this on living abroad as a child). I speak fluent English and intermediate Turkish. I'd love to improve my Turkish and professionally use my skill.

Some proud achievements in my life:
• I won a team-working and leadership award at Pace Youth Theatre in 2018.
•I became an anti-bully ambassador at school in 2019. 
• I became class representative in 2022 at West College Scotland.
• I successfully graduated a Software Development Bootcamp with 3 projects despite it liquidating 2 weeks into my course.
• I raised £700 for Marie Curie and trekked up to 3500m in Morocco in 2024.
