<h1 align="center">Hi I'm Melika!👋🏼</h1> 

I’m an IT Support Technician with a passion for helping people get the most out of their technology. I enjoy solving problems, improving efficiency, and ensuring that users feel supported and confident in their IT environments.

With experience troubleshooting hardware, software, and network issues, I focus on delivering clear, reliable, and friendly support. I take pride in translating technical solutions into everyday language, so users not only resolve their issues but also feel empowered to prevent future ones.

I enjoy team-working, socialising, and eating good food. I also love to travel and meet new people, (I blame this on living abroad as a child). I speak fluent English and intermediate Turkish. I'd love to improve my Turkish and professionally use my skill.

Some proud achievements in my life:
• I won a team-working and leadership award at Pace Youth Theatre in 2018.
•I became an anti-bully ambassador at school in 2019. 
• I became class representative in 2022 at West College Scotland.
• I successfully graduated a Software Development Bootcamp with 3 projects despite it liquidating 2 weeks into my course.
• I raised £700 for Marie Curie and trekked up to 3500m in Morocco in 2024.
